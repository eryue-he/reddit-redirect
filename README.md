# Reddit Redirect

- Browser: Chromium based web browser

## Purpose
Redirect Reddit to something usable because
this website has been popping up in search
results a lot for the past decade, at least
previously the ui was tolerable. Maybe
they'll lock the site behind registration
too, good riddance. xd

## Installation
- Download or clone the repository
- Go to browser extensions
- Click on "Manage extensions"
- Click on "Load Unpacked"
